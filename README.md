# QA-DevOps-Fundamental-Project- MCQ App
This repository contains my work for the QA devops fundamental project.  
The brief for this project was to produce a Flask web app, of our choosing, which has CRUD functionality. The additional requirements were a MySQL database with at least one many-to-one relationship between two tables, use of a project tracking system, version control system and CI server to automate testing.  
I have chosen to produce a multiple-choice question app which allows users to add, view, update and delete questions and options. The minimum viable product for this was initially designed as follows:
